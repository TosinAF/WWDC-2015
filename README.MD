CandlePath is an iOS application that enables anyone to find their way home safely, using open street light data to ensure you stay out of the dark and GPS to keep make sure you stay on route. Using an in-app PayPal purchase allows anyone to buy a safe night that ensures your family and security services are notified when you deviate from your path.<br/>

Built by Simon, Joe, Adam & I during the London Paypal BattleHack Hackathon.<br/> 
The Application won 1st Place at the hackathons & my team got a free trip to San Jose to represent London at the BattleHack World Finals.<br/>
